# Privacy Policy for Deltarune Prophecy Panel Generator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Deltarune Prophecy Panel Generator, a creative web tool that allows fans to create custom prophecy panels inspired by Toby Fox's DELTARUNE. Your privacy is important to us, and this privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our generator.

## Information Collection and Use

We collect minimal data to provide you with the best prophecy-creating experience:

1. **Image Uploads**

   - **What We Collect**: Images you upload to create prophecy panels are processed locally in your browser.
   - **Purpose**: To generate custom prophecy panels with your chosen images.
   - **Storage**: Images are NOT stored on our servers - all processing happens on your device.

2. **Usage Analytics**

   - **What We Collect**: Anonymous usage statistics such as page views and feature usage.
   - **Purpose**: To understand which features are popular and improve the generator.

3. **Browser Information**

   - **What We Collect**: Basic technical information like browser type and screen resolution.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure the generator works properly across different devices and browsers.

4. **Local Storage**

   - **What We Use**: Browser local storage to save your preferences (theme selection, scale settings).
   - **Purpose**: To remember your settings for a better user experience.

## Data Storage and Security

Since the Deltarune Prophecy Panel Generator processes everything locally in your browser:

- Your uploaded images never leave your device
- Generated prophecy panels are created entirely on your computer
- We don't store any personal information or creative content on our servers
- Your browser's local storage can be cleared at any time through your browser settings

## Information Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share any user information. The generator is a free fan tool created for the DELTARUNE community. We may share anonymous usage statistics publicly to show the tool's popularity.

## Third-Party Services

We may use third-party analytics services to understand usage patterns. These services collect anonymous data and do not have access to your uploaded images or generated content.

## Children's Privacy

The Deltarune Prophecy Panel Generator is designed to be safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the generator after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
