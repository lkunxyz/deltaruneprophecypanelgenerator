# Depth Texture Assets

This directory should contain the following texture files for the Prophecy Panel Generator:

1. `depth-text.png` - Text texture overlay
2. `depth-blue.png` - Blue panel texture
3. `depth-darker-new.png` - Dark background texture

These textures are used for visual effects in the prophecy panel generation.

## Placeholder

For development, the component will work without these files, but the visual effects will be limited.
