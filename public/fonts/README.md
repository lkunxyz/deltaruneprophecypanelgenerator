# Fonts Required

This directory should contain the following font files:

1. `prophecy-type.woff2` - The main Deltarune prophecy-style font
2. `dtm-sans.woff2` - DTM Sans fallback font

These fonts are required for the Prophecy Panel Generator to work correctly.

## Font Sources

- ProphecyType: A serif font that mimics the Deltarune prophecy panel style
- DTMSans: A clean sans-serif font used as fallback

## Placeholder

For development, you can use these alternatives:
- Georgia or Times New Roman as ProphecyType substitute
- Arial or Helvetica as DTMSans substitute

The component will fall back to system fonts if these files are not present.
